# Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Project

A web-based implementation of Quantum Key Distribution protocols using quantum computing principles. This project demonstrates secure key exchange between two parties using quantum mechanics properties.

## Overview

This project implements QKD protocols to showcase how quantum cryptography can be used for secure communication. The application provides an interactive web interface to simulate and visualize quantum key distribution processes.

## Features

- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit
- Quantum circuit simulation using Qiskit
- Visual representation of quantum key distribution protocols
- Real-time quantum state analysis
- Educational demonstrations of quantum cryptography concepts

## Dependencies

- **Streamlit (1.29.0)**: Web application framework for the user interface
- **NumPy (1.26.0)**: Numerical computing library for mathematical operations
- **Qiskit (0.43.0)**: IBM's quantum computing framework for quantum circuit simulation

## Installation
